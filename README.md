## Heya!
My name is Nathan Cochran, and I'm a passionate developer who loves working on creative software projects. 

Check out my portfolio [here](https://www.nathancochran.com/)!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Bumper Vehicles, a 2.5D multiplayer online game where you compete against other players in action-packed arenas loaded with dangers all about. Some key technologies I'm using include p5.js, Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL.
